## CLI tool not found after installation

If you installed a tool via `go install` but it's not found:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your GOPATH">
    Ensure `$GOBIN` (or `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`) is in your `PATH`.

    ```bash
    echo $(go env GOPATH)/bin
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to PATH">
    Add to your shell profile:

    ```bash
    export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Mail forwarding alias not working

- **Did you confirm via email?** — Check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation link.
- **Is the domain active?** — The domain must be authorized in the database.
- **DNS misconfigured?** — MX, SPF, and DMARC records must be set correctly. See the [DNS Configuration guide](/mail-forwarding-selfhost/dns-configuration).

## API returns 429 / rate limited

All tools and services enforce rate limits. Reduce your request rate:

```bash
# Example: reduce to 1 request per second
tool-name -t target --rate-limit 1
```

## TLS verification errors

If you're behind a proxy or in a lab environment, use `-k` / `--insecure` to bypass TLS verification. **Do not use in production.**
