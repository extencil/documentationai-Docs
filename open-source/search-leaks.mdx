description: >-
  OSINT CLI tool to query data breach/leak statistics by domain or email using
  public threat-intel APIs. Supports stdin and target lists, automatic type
  detection, forced modes, and structured output.
---

**search-leaks** is an open-source, OSINT-focused command-line tool maintained by a **member of** [Haltman.io](https://haltman.io). It queries **public threat-intelligence endpoints from Hudson Rock (Cavalier OSINT)** to retrieve **statistical indicators** related to data leaks, credential exposure, and infostealer activity.

The tool consumes **statistical JSON responses only** and prints structured, greppable output suitable for reports, internal reviews, and automated pipelines.

Typical use cases:

- Vendor and third-party risk assessment
- Corporate exposure checks (domain-level)
- Mailbox exposure validation during incident response
- High-level breach risk reporting without handling raw stolen data

## Configuration

**No configuration is required.**

- No API keys
- No environment variables
- No config files

All behavior is controlled via **CLI flags** and execution mode.

---

## Usage

### Basic usage

Single domain:

```bash
search-leaks -t example.com
```

Single email:

```bash
search-leaks -t user@example.com
```

---

### Target input methods

Supported input sources:

- `--target / -t` (repeatable, comma-separated)
- `--target-list / -tL` (file paths, repeatable)
- `stdin` / pipeline

```bash
search-leaks -t google.com,twitter.com
```

```bash
search-leaks -tL targets1.txt -tL targets2.txt
```

```bash
cat targets.txt | search-leaks
```

---

### Execution modes

Only **one mode** can be active per run.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Automatic (default)" icon="zap">
    Automatically detects target type — email → email endpoint, anything else → domain endpoint.

    ```bash
    search-leaks -t example.com -t user@example.com
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Forced domain" icon="globe">
    All targets are treated as **domains**. If an email is provided, its domain is extracted.

    ```bash
    search-leaks -d -t user@corp.com
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Forced email" icon="mail">
    All targets are treated as **emails**. If a domain is provided, it is expanded into common mailbox aliases (`postmaster@`, `abuse@`, `admin@`, etc.).

    ```bash
    search-leaks -e -t example.com
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

### Statistics-only mode (domain)

For quick reporting, use **statistics-only** output:

```bash
search-leaks --statistics -t tesla.com
```

Prints **only high-signal fields**: `total`, `employees`, `users`, `third_parties`, `last_employee_compromised`, `last_user_compromised`.

---

## Output format

Output is **structured and line-oriented**, designed for easy parsing:

```text
[target] [request_url]
[target] [key: value]
[target] [arrayItem(n)] [key: value]
```

Example (email query):

```text
[user@example.com] [total_corporate_services: 5]
[user@example.com] [stealer(1)] [operating_system: Windows 10]
```

Disable ANSI colors:

```bash
search-leaks --no-color
```

---

## Possible Problems / Important Notes

### Rate limiting

- Enforced limit: **50 requests per 10 seconds**
- The tool automatically throttles requests
- Execution **aborts after 3 consecutive API errors**

### Privacy & data handling

- Only **statistical metadata** is retrieved
- No breach payloads, passwords, or raw dumps are stored
- Output is printed directly to stdout

### Intended use

This tool is intended for authorized security testing, corporate exposure assessment, and vendor risk analysis. Do **not** use it to target individuals or organizations without authorization.
